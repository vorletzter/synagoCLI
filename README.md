Some fooling around with the Android-Matrix-SDK

A plain and simple Messenger using the Matrix Protocol.
UI is inspired by popular Messenger UIs but still a mess.

Features
- Login with an extsiting Account
- See all joined Chats
- Recvieve and Write unencrypted Text Messages
- showing Avtars for Rooms/Users 
- Implementing Multi Accounts

Next in Pipe
- OLM/Encryption
- MediaHandler for Chatrooms (Images, URLs)
- Create/Join/Invite Users/Rooms
=> The Messenger is roughly on par with Conversations
- Write a better Matrix-Android-SDK Introduction/Tutorial to get folks started.

Needs at least Android 4.4/API19
but is Compatible with Android Oreo

Uses the Matrix-Android-SDK
No 3rd Party Tracker oder Cloud Services like Stetho or Firebase used
